GenericTestMod
======

This contains the basic forge example mod with a few extra parts

This is a mod to test random features. There will also be branches for fabric possibly though the focus is forge for now.

Examples:  
Ore Generation  
Feature Generation  
Custom Features  
Mixins  


/build/tmp/jar/

The META-INF will be ignored in the resources though it is needed to properly link mixins for now without anything else.
